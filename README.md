Technical presentation on Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

This project contains a technical presentation I delivered on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and simplifies and scales modern network operations

## Overview

Traditionally, network devices tightly couple the control plane with the underlying hardware. SDN decouples the
control plane from physical devices, enabling centralized, software-driven control of the network. This architecture
makes networks more flexible, programmable, and easier to automate.

The presentation covers:

- What SDN is and why it matters
- Common network automation tasks
- Key benefits of SDN and automation in modern environments

## Contents

- `sdn-automation-presentation.pptx` — Original PowerPoint presentation

## Key automation tasks covered

- Inventory and device provisioning
- Software upgrades and policy enforcement
- Monitoring and analytics
- Detecting issues and anomalies
- Access control updates

## Benefits of SDN and automation

- Centralized network control
- Faster, more efficient operations
- Reduced operational costs and less on-site travel
- Easier vendor format conversion and standardization
